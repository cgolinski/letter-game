*** To Do ***

Next feature: 

- Add favicon
- Rename git repo to quoned 
- Grep for "Peel" and Bananas. If <6, rename to something else.
- Add tiny "quoned?" on homepage and link to Seinfeld video.
- Fill out ReadMe on React -- see others for what belongs there.
	To run:
		1. clone repo
		2. npm start


- Make site responsive (test on phones)
- Cross device test
- Dump feature: put 1 letter back in LetterPile, pull 3 more from LetterPile
	- Add two Qs back into letterPile (removed because blocks game without dump feature)
	- Drag letter onto dump area
	- Three more letters automatically appear on board (peel 3)
- Maybe move css away from inline styles to plain css files, so that :hover and media queries will work
- Set hover and click styles.
- Clean up
	- remove bananas button and just change the name of the peel button when nextPeelWins
	- Merge MainMenu.jsx and StartingOptions.jsx
	- Merge MenuBar.jsx and LetterPileInfo.jsx
	


- Achievements as you go? (5-letter word, 6-letter word, etc. win with <5 words, use certain jargon words, win with no dumping, win in < 5 mins, all words start with same letter, all words longer than 4 letters, )

- Make multiplayer game
	- Change difficulty level to number of players
	- Force number of players to be selected before game starts
	- Connect to server
	- Create one board per player
	- Render small version of other players' boards in each player's view

- Create beginning-of-game options: 
	- special rules (two letter words allowed? timed? size of grid? number of tiles? pass unused tiles to neighbouring player? peel two letters at once?)
	- single player (vs computer, with timer, auto-timed peels)
	- themes (all words from certain category)

- Make more secure by doing word validation on server side (currently on client side)


*** Issues ***

- Plus sign briefly flashes as tile starts being dragged.
