*** To Do ***

Next feature: 
1. - Create game over status when all tiles placed
   - When game over, check all words are connected, all words are in dictionary
   - Stats screen
   	 - time elapsed
   	 - # moves
   	 - # words
   	 - longest word
   	 - average word length



When game over (bananas clicked?), setState(game over: true)
Game Over component gets loaded into MenuBar (left half of Game screen)

restartGame function would live in App.jsx, get passed down as prop, and get called in gameOverBanner when button is clicked.

restartGame is same as starting new game, but some items in state get set or stay the same or get cleared
state for all game
state that gets reset for each game --> get put into newGame function. That function gets called when you start the first game, and again when you restart game.
If starting first game, then choose starting Options, that sets persistent state items, and then calls newGame function which clears the other items in state.

New Game: Starting options sets persistent state items. Calls newGame to wipe other state items. Calls function to render grid.
Repeat Game: (Persistent state items don't get touched.) Clicking Play Again button calls newGame which creates new state items (empty Global Erros, new LetterPile, etc.) and then setsState which re-renders everything.





- Achievements as you go? (5-letter word, 6-letter word, etc. win with <5 words, use certain jargon words, win with no dumping, win in < 5 mins, all words start with same letter, all words longer than 4 letters, )
- Merge MainMenu.jsx and StartingOptions.jsx
- Merge MenuBar.jsx and LetterPileInfo.jsx
- Maybe move css away from inline styles to plain css files, so that :hover and media queries will work
- Make site responsive (test on phones)
- Make Futura font or alternate font available on other browser
- Add favicon
- Force number of players to be selected before game starts
- Dump feature: put 1 letter back in LetterPile, pull 3 more from LetterPile
- Connect to server
- Create one board per player
- Render small version of other players' boards in each player's view

- Create beginning-of-game options: 
	- special rules (two letter words allowed? timed? size of grid? number of tiles? pass unused tiles to neighbouring player? peel two letters at once?)
	- single player (vs computer, with timer, auto-timed peels)
	- themes (all words from certain category)

- Make more secure by doing word validation on server side (currently on client side)
- Remove blue outline from around buttons (e.g. Peel) when clicked. Set other hover and click styles.



*** Issues ***

- Plus sign briefly flashes as tile starts being dragged.
