*** To Do ***

Next feature: 
Check all words are connected
- look up algorithm for making sure all words are connected to other words
	- maybe use a flood fill algorithm (like paintbrush to fill contents), fills all 	
		contiguous cells that contain a tile. 
	- Then check to make sure equals total number of tiles on board.






- Connect to server
- Create one board per player
- Render small version of other players' boards in each player's view

- Create beginning-of-game options: 
	- special rules (two letter words allowed? timed? size of grid? number of tiles? pass unused tiles to neighbouring player? peel two letters at once?)
	- single player (vs computer, with timer, auto-timed peels)
	- themes (all words from certain category)

- Create game over status when all tiles placed
- When game over, check all words are connected, all rules are in dictionary





*** Issues ***

- Plus sign briefly flashes as tile starts being dragged.
