*** To Do ***

Next feature: 
1. - Create game over status when all tiles placed
   - When game over, check all words are connected, all words are in dictionary


- Maybe move css away from inline styles to plain css files, so that :hover and media queries will work
- Make site responsive (test on phones)
- Make Futura font or alternate font available on other browser
- Add favicon
- Force number of players to be selected before game starts
- Dump feature: put 1 letter back in LetterPile, pull 3 more from LetterPile
- Connect to server
- Create one board per player
- Render small version of other players' boards in each player's view

- Create beginning-of-game options: 
	- special rules (two letter words allowed? timed? size of grid? number of tiles? pass unused tiles to neighbouring player? peel two letters at once?)
	- single player (vs computer, with timer, auto-timed peels)
	- themes (all words from certain category)

- Make more secure by doing word validation on server side (currently on client side)
- Remove blue outline from around buttons (e.g. Peel) when clicked. Set other hover and click styles.



*** Issues ***

- Plus sign briefly flashes as tile starts being dragged.
