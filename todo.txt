*** To Do ***

Next feature: 


- Help button on game screen that shows rules.
	- DONE: button directly in letterPileInfo
	- DONE: help component contains explanation page, not button
	- DONE: button makes help component appear (by top transition?)
		Do in this order:
		1. DONE: Create function to change style directly in variable  
		2. DONE: Update function to change state (passed down as prop), if statement to change styles 
		3. DONE: Update function to transition top, not to change from hidden to active.	 
		4. DONE: Remove help default and active styles from letterPileInfo and move into help component. 
			 Move function into help component
		5. DONE: Style like gameOverBanner.   
	- DONE: Help page styles go in help component (just like GameOverBanner component)
	- git branch, add, and commit
	- Ask Rob how to improve (e.g. toggleHelp and showHelp props)
	- Ask Rob to improve design
		// DONE: button moves to bottom right of game screen
		// DONE: normal brown background, light brown solid border and font color
		// DONE: change font to Helvetica or another normal looking "?"
	- Issue: If you zoom in very big, the off-screen banners show on screen -- move higher up? bottom offset? 
	//NOPE: try -em instead of -px or -%
	//OR
	//put inside a div that has 0px height and full width
	////transition bottom of that container div to 85% height
	////OR
	////transition helpbanner bottom might make it show
	//OR
	//transition left to right
	//OR
	//overflow scroll, height 85%



- Dump feature: put 1 letter back in LetterPile, pull 3 more from LetterPile
- Add favicon
- Remove blue outline from around buttons (e.g. Peel) when clicked. 
- Maybe move css away from inline styles to plain css files, so that :hover and media queries will work
- Set hover and click styles.
- Make "All words must be connected" disappear when a letter is moved after peel.
- Make site responsive (test on phones)
- Cross browser test
- Cross device test
- Rename git repo to quoned 
- Clean up
	- remove bananas button and just change the name of the peel button when nextPeelWins
	- Merge MainMenu.jsx and StartingOptions.jsx
	- Merge MenuBar.jsx and LetterPileInfo.jsx
	


- Achievements as you go? (5-letter word, 6-letter word, etc. win with <5 words, use certain jargon words, win with no dumping, win in < 5 mins, all words start with same letter, all words longer than 4 letters, )

- Make Futura font or alternate font available on other browser
- Force number of players to be selected before game starts
- Connect to server
- Create one board per player
- Render small version of other players' boards in each player's view

- Create beginning-of-game options: 
	- special rules (two letter words allowed? timed? size of grid? number of tiles? pass unused tiles to neighbouring player? peel two letters at once?)
	- single player (vs computer, with timer, auto-timed peels)
	- themes (all words from certain category)

- Make more secure by doing word validation on server side (currently on client side)

- Add tiny "quoned?" on homepage and link to Seinfeld video.

- Plus sign briefly flashes as tile starts being dragged.
- Styles and dragging broken in Firefox
