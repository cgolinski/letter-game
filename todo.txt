*** To Do ***

Next feature: 
1. Game Over
   - Stats screen
   	 - time elapsed
   	 - # moves
   	 - # words
   	 - longest word
   	 - average word length


- Achievements as you go? (5-letter word, 6-letter word, etc. win with <5 words, use certain jargon words, win with no dumping, win in < 5 mins, all words start with same letter, all words longer than 4 letters, )
- Merge MainMenu.jsx and StartingOptions.jsx
- Merge MenuBar.jsx and LetterPileInfo.jsx
- Maybe move css away from inline styles to plain css files, so that :hover and media queries will work
- Make site responsive (test on phones)
- Make Futura font or alternate font available on other browser
- Add favicon
- Force number of players to be selected before game starts
- Dump feature: put 1 letter back in LetterPile, pull 3 more from LetterPile
- Connect to server
- Create one board per player
- Render small version of other players' boards in each player's view

- Create beginning-of-game options: 
	- special rules (two letter words allowed? timed? size of grid? number of tiles? pass unused tiles to neighbouring player? peel two letters at once?)
	- single player (vs computer, with timer, auto-timed peels)
	- themes (all words from certain category)

- Make more secure by doing word validation on server side (currently on client side)
- Remove blue outline from around buttons (e.g. Peel) when clicked. Set other hover and click styles.



*** Issues ***

- Plus sign briefly flashes as tile starts being dragged.
