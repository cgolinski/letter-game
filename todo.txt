*** To Do ***

Next feature: 

Make two new components under App.jsx
	- Game (holds everything currently in App.jsx)
	- Main Menu (startingOptions)
	- Then if statement to toggle between rendering Game and Main Menu



- Dump feature: put 1 letter back in LetterPile, pull 3 more from LetterPile
- Connect to server
- Create one board per player
- Render small version of other players' boards in each player's view

- Create beginning-of-game options: 
	- special rules (two letter words allowed? timed? size of grid? number of tiles? pass unused tiles to neighbouring player? peel two letters at once?)
	- single player (vs computer, with timer, auto-timed peels)
	- themes (all words from certain category)

- Create game over status when all tiles placed
- When game over, check all words are connected, all rules are in dictionary

- Redesign




*** Issues ***

- Plus sign briefly flashes as tile starts being dragged.
